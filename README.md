# ETC5512: Assignment 1 - Qantas Data Extraction Project

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 1 of the ETC5512 unit (Wild-caught data). 

## Objective

This project aims to evaluate the understanding and application of data collection limitations, utilizing open data sources, and organizing data for analytical purposes. It focuses on addressing two key questions for Qantas regarding potential new flight destinations in the USA and the selection of a location for a new storage facility in Australia.

## Data Collection

- **Sources**: Downloaded data from two different open data sources relevant to Qantas' requirements.
- **Selection of Variables**: Selected appropriate variables to address the assignment's problem statement.
- **Process**: Documented the process of data extraction and variable selection.

## Data Organization

- **Structure**: Organized the extracted data in a structured format suitable for analysis by an analytics team.
- **Readability**: Ensured the data is readable and informative, with clear labels and explanations where necessary.

## Limitations of Data

- **Assessment**: Critically assessed and documented limitations associated with each data source used.
- **Impact**: Considered how these limitations may impact the analysis conducted by the analytics team at Qantas.

## Documentation

- **Steps**: Detailed the steps taken to retrieve, select, and organize the data.
- **Rationale**: Discussed the rationale behind variable selection and the format chosen for presenting the data.
- **Limitations**: Included a section on the identified limitations of the data sources and their potential implications.

## Potential Use of Data

- **Application**: Described how the organized data can be utilized by the analytics team at Qantas to solve the problem at hand.
- **Insights**: Highlighted specific insights or trends that could be derived from the data, considering its limitations.

## Conclusion

- **Summary**: Summarized the key findings and the overall process of accessing, selecting, and organizing open data for analysis.
- **Importance**: Emphasized the importance of understanding data limitations in conducting meaningful analytics.

This project serves as a comprehensive guide for the Qantas analytics team to navigate through the complexities of data collection, organization, and analysis with a clear understanding of its limitations and potential.
